# Description: 
The code begins by importing necessary libraries: speech_recognition for speech recognition, googlesearch for performing Google searches, webbrowser for opening web pages, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion.  The main function is defined to handle the core functionality of the script:  It initializes the text-to-speech engine (pyttsx3) as x. It initializes the speech recognition engine (speech_recognition) as r. Within a with block, it uses the system's microphone as the audio source. It adjusts for ambient noise to improve speech recognition accuracy. The script greets the user by saying "Welcome, I am Angel." Inside a while loop, the script repeatedly prompts the user to say what they want to search for. It listens for the user's speech input and recognizes it using Google's speech recognition service. The recognized speech is spoken back to the user, and the recognized text is stored in the query variable in lowercase. If the recognized text is not "exit terminal," the script performs a Google search using googlesearch to find the first search result. The first search result is opened in a new browser tab using webbrowser. The loop continues until the user says "exit terminal." The script then checks whether it's being run directly (__name__ == "__main__") and if so, it calls the main function to start the interaction with the user.  Overall, this code uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to create an interactive voice-based search tool. It prompts the user to speak a search query, recognizes the speech, confirms the query, and performs a Google search to open the first search result in a new browser tab. The user can exit the interaction by saying "exit terminal."
